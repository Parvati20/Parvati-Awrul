// what is javacript?
// Javascript is a single threaded, synchronous and dynamic typed programming language. It means it can execute only one task at a time.
// However, JavaScript also supports asynchronous tasks, such as network requests or timers, which allow other code to run while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. So, while computations themselves can be synchronous, JavaScript's event-driven architecture enables handling of asynchronous tasks effectively.
// synchronous means:-you can not run two tasks simultaneously
// example:-calculation

// synchronous:-Synchronous means that things happen one after the other, in order. If a task is synchronous, 
// the next task has to wait until the current one is finished before it can start.

//  It’s like waiting in line: you can only move forward when the person in front of you is done.
// EXAMPLE:-
// 1.addition(calculation)
// 2.computation


// Asynchronous means that tasks can happen at the same time or out of order. When something is asynchronous, 
// one task can start while another task is still running, so you don’t have to wait for one to finish before starting the next.

//  It’s like being able to cook dinner while waiting for the laundry to finish; you can do both without having to stop one for the other.
// example:-API,request,fetching Data,web APIs,promises,macro task

// Dynamic Language
// A dynamic language is one where you can change the type of a variable while the program is running. For example, you can start with a number and later change that variable to hold a string without any issues. This flexibility makes coding easier, but it can lead to unexpected results if you’re not careful.

// Static Language
// A static language is one where the type of a variable is fixed when you write the code. Once you declare a variable as a specific type (like a number or a string), it can’t change to another type later. This helps catch errors earlier, but it can be less flexible when writing code.


// JSON.parse
// Purpose: Converts a JSON string back into a JavaScript object.
// Usage: This is useful when you receive JSON data from a server and want to use it in your application.

// JSON.stringify
// Purpose: Converts a JavaScript object or value into a JSON string.
// Usage: This is useful when you want to send data to a server or store it in local storage, as JSON strings can easily be transmitted and stored.
